The program calculates the MD5 Checksum for a file and compares
it to a given MD5 checksum string.

Example

You are provided with a .zip file:

*[.rom.zip]() -- `MD5: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e`
Installation
-----------

Run the .jar.

Usage
-----

    1. Press File > Open File...
    2. Navigate to "rom.zip" and press open.
    			The MD5 for the file becomes visible in the lower text field.
    3. Paste the provided MD5 from the source of the file into the lower text field.
    			"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427"
    4. The background of the textfields becomes green if the checksums match, otherwise red.
